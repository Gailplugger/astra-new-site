# Indian Cybercrime Laws Every Teen Must Know — Because “I Didn’t Know” Won’t Save You

Let’s cut the nonsense — **teens are getting arrested every week in India for cybercrimes they didn’t even realize were illegal.**  
Not because they’re criminals… but because they were careless enough to believe:

**“Bro it’s just for fun”**  
**“Everyone does it”**  
**“I’m just learning hacking”**

Reality check:
> **The Indian IT Act doesn’t care about your intentions. It only cares about the action.**

If the cyber cell traces it to your device — you’re done.

## 🚨 Why You MUST Read This
Most teenagers think things like:
- Hacking an Instagram account
- Cracking Wi-Fi passwords
- Using RATs or Telegram logs groups
- Buying databases
- Blackmailing “as a prank”
- Spreading private images

…are harmless experiments.

No.  
Under Indian cyber law, **each of these is a criminal offence**, and teens **DO go to jail** for them.

## 🧠 Real Case Examples That Should Scare You

### **1. 19-year-old arrested for hacking flight booking website**
A teen hacked the MSIL website and booked tickets worth ₹2.9 lakh.  
Thought he was smart.  
Cyber cell tracked his email & IP → **Arrested. Life ruined.**

### **2. 17-year-old arrested for Instagram blackmail**
